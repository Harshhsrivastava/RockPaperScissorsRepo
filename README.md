Title: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

Description:
The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a simple yet classic game that pits the player against the computer in a battle of wits and luck. In this project, we'll create an interactive version of this game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Key Features:

User Interface: The game will have a clean and intuitive user interface designed using HTML and CSS. It will include elements for displaying the game options (rock, paper, and scissors), the current score, and a section to display the result of each round.
Game Logic: JavaScript will handle the game's logic, including determining the winner of each round based on the choices made by the player and the computer. It will also keep track of the score and update it accordingly after each round.
Interactivity: Users will be able to select their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) by clicking on the corresponding button. After the user makes a choice, the computer will randomly select its choice, and the result of the round will be displayed on the screen.
Score Tracking: The game will keep track of the score, displaying the number of wins, losses, and ties. The score will update dynamically as the player plays more rounds.
Overall, this project will provide an enjoyable and interactive experience for users as they play the timeless game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. It's a great way to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while having fun!
